# Circles
Android App that has buttons that draw circles onto the screen 

How it works:
Press the button labelled 5, and it creates 5 circles.
Press the button labelled 7 and it creates 7 circles.
Press the button labelled 10, and it creates 10 circles.
Press the button labelled circle, and it makes all the circles go next to each other to create a bigger circle.
Press the button labelled line, and it makes all the circles go horizontally perpendicular to each other.

TO-DO:
Fix disappearing buttons - The functionality of the buttons works, creating the circles, but when the user presses the buttons, the buttons disappear from the screen.
